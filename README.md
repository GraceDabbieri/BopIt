#Bop It.
This is a small program I wrote in python to let you play a simulated version of the Bop It Extreme from 1998. The game is functional, but this is very much a beginner project of mine which does need some improvement.
#How to play.
Install the python packages, and launch BopIt.py. A dialog will give you directions on how to play the game.
#A quick note.
When compiling with pyinstaller, nuitka, or other similar programs, windows defender flags the program as a potential virus.
